# MiniCompiler

This project is a simple **MiniCompiler** designed to demonstrate the basic phases of a compiler. It was developed as part of a group project for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Open File:** Load a file containing code for analysis.
- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the input code and identifies invalid tokens.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Checks the structure of the code for compliance with language rules.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Verifies variable declarations and type consistency.
- **Clear:** Clear all inputs and outputs with a single button.

## Scope

The MiniCompiler focuses on **variable declaration and initialization** only.  
- It validates the syntax and semantics of variable declarations.  
- It ensures type compatibility during initialization.  

**Limitations:**
- This compiler does not support operations beyond variable declaration and initialization.
- It does not generate machine code or execute the code.

**Syntax Accepted**
- `var <identifier> : <type> [= <value>];`
